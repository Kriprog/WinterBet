# **WinterBet**

## Overview

**WinterBet** is a program developed for an internship test assignment. It is designed to extract information from `match_data` and `player_data` text files. The processed data is then used to create a new text file within the `bettingDataProcessor` package, where the main class is located.

## How to Run

To run the program, follow these steps:

1. Open the project in your preferred Java development environment.
2. Locate and run the `BettingDataProcessorApplication` class, which serves as the entry point for the program.
3. The program will read data from the `match_data.txt` and `player_data.txt` files in the `resources` package.
4. Processed data will be saved to a new `result.txt` file in the `bettingDataProcessor` package.

## File Structure

- `src`: Contains the source code for the **WinterBet** program.
  - `bettingDataProcessor`: Main package containing the program's logic.
    - `BettingDataProcessorApplication`: Entry point for the program.
    - `DataFileReader`: Reads and processes data from files.
    - `results.txt`: Output file generated by the program.
  - `resources`: Contains input files (`match_data.txt` and `player_data.txt`).
  

## How It Works

The program follows these key steps:

1. Reads match and player data from input files.
2. Processes the data to identify legal and illegal player actions.
3. Calculates player balances, net amounts, win rates, casino balance.
4. Generates an output file (`results.txt`) with information on legitimate, illegitimate players and final casino balance.
